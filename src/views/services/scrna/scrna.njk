    <p>
      scRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a common and powerful technique for profiling the whole
      transcriptome of a large number of individual cells. The analysis of the huge volumes of data
      generated by these experiments necessitates the use of sophisticated
      statistical and computational tools.

    <p>
      In RNA sequencing, RNA is typically extracted from a tissue that contains a variety of cell types.
      This issue has been solved by using a single cell. Cells would be sorted prior to RNA-seq, and
      RNA-seq would be performed on specific cell types separately. The data will then be analyzed
      using a variety of cell types. The following is the workflow we use to perform scRNA-seq analysis:

    <ul>
      <li>Step 1 - Quality control and data preprocessing</li>
      <li>Step 2 - Data normalization</li>
      <li>Step 3 - Feature selection</li>
      <li>Step 4 - Dimensionality reduction</li>
      <li>Step 5 - Cell clustering</li>
      <li>Step 6 - Differential expression for expressed features</li>
      <li>Step 7 - Cell type annotation</li>
      <li>Step 8 - Data visualization</li>
    </ul>

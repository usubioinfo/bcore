    <h2 class="title">scRNA</h2>

    <p>
      scRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a common and powerful technique for profiling the whole 
      transcriptome of a large number of individual cells. The analysis of the huge volumes of data 
      generated by these experiments requires the use of sophisticated statistical and computational 
      tools.  In RNA sequencing, RNA is typically extracted from a tissue that contains a variety of cell 
      types. This issue has been solved by using a single cell. Cells would be sorted prior to RNA-seq, 
      and RNAseq would be performed on specific cell types separately. The data will then be 
      analyzed using a variety of cell types.

    <h4>Three Main Stages for Performing scRNA-Seq Data Analysis</h4>

    <p>
      scRNA-Seq is processed for the first part like general steps for any high throughput sequencing 
      data. However, after mapping and read count, the later steps require a mix of existing RNASeq 
      analysis methods and novel methods to address the technical difference of scRNASeq. Finally, 
      the biological interpretation is analyzed with methods specifically developed for scRNASeq. 
      Followed is the workflow we use to perform scRNA-seq analysis.

    <h4>Regardless of droplet method, the following are important for a good quantification at the cellular level</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Sample Index:</b> to keep track of which sample the read come from</li>
      <li><b>Cellular barcode:</b> to keep track of which cell the read come from</li>
      <li><b>Unique molecular identifier (UMI):</b> to find out of which transcript molecule the read comes from</li>
      <li><b>Sequencing read1: </b> the read1 sequence</li>
      <li><b>Sequencing read2: </b> the read2 sequence</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Step 1 - Quality Control and Data Preprocessing</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Formatting reads and filtering noisy cellular barcodes</li>
        <li>Assigning reads to their cellular barcodes and molecules of origin</li>
        <li>Demultiplexing the samples</li>
        <li>Generate a file of counts for each cellular barcode</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 2 - Mapping</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Mapping/pseudo-mapping to transcriptome</li>
        <li>Gene assignment</li>
        <li>Barcode counts</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 3 - Post-QC Mapping</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Collapsing UMIs and Quantification of Reads</li>
        <li>Find which cDNA was the origin of the tag a UMI was attached to</li>
        <li>Count unique UMIs for (gene, UMI) pairings</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 5 - Data Normalization</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Calculate Cell-to-cell variation in the dataset (i.e., genes that are highly expressed in some cells and lowly expressed in others)</li>

      </ul>
      <li>Step 7 - Dimensionality Reduction</li>

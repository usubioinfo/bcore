					The USU HPC uses a module system that allows users to customize their work environment and use only the software they
					need for their projects. This is because we have so many available modules (120+ currently, and 3 commercial). If you would like to know more about
					working with modules, please see our <a href="resources/manuals">Manuals</a> page. There is a list of available modules below, as well as
					their respective versions. If there is a module that you donâ€™t see but would like added, please contact our
					system administrator.

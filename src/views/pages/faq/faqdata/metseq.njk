  {
    question: "What is methyl-Seq?",
    content: "Is a technique that can determine DNA methylation patterns. The major difference from regular sequencing experiments is that, in bisulfite sequencing DNA is treated with bisulfite which convert cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. By sequencing and aligning those converted DNA fragments it is possible to call methylation status on the methylation states of individual cytosines."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Epigenetics?",
    content: "Epigenetic is the study of post translational gene modification that leads to change in gene expression without changing the original DNA sequence of the gene. There are main mechanisms of epigenetics: DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA regulation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is DNA Methylation?",
    content: "DNA methylation is the best-studied epigenetic modification. This process occurs when a hydrogen atom at fifth carbon residue is replaced by a methyl group. DNA methylation occurs in a variety of biological processes:
<ul> 
<li>Aging</li> 
<li>Cancer</li> 
<li>cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>Neuro-degenerative disease</li>
<li>Auto-immune disease</li>
</ul>
DNA methylation presents a good <b>diagnostic</b> and <ul><b>therapeutic</b></ul> target."
  },
  {
    question: "What are CpG Islands?",
    content: "CpG islands (CGI) are genomic areas with a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides. Because they are methylated, they play an important role in transcription regulation. CGIs are frequently found near or within promoters (70 percent of promoters have CGIs). Methylation of CGIs is one of the major mechanisms involved in gene expression regulation."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the different types of Bi-sulfite sequencing?",
    content: "Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing (TBS): Bisulfite sequencing method to detect base resolution DNA methylation at a targeted region of interest.
                      Reduced  Representation  Bi-sulfite  Sequencing  (RRBS): Bisulfite  sequencing  method  utilized  to detect nearly all CpG sites across the entiregenome at base resolution detail.
                      Whole  Genome  Bi-sulfite  Sequencing  (WGBS): Complete  genome  coverage  of  methylation  at every CpG site and less common non-CpG sites such as CNG."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)?",
    content: "This method combines the power of high-throughput DNA sequencing with sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA. When DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite, a chemical compound, unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil."
  },
  {
    question: "How much sequencing depth (number of reads) needed for WGBS?",
    content: "Paired-end sequencing with either <b>100 or 150bp reads</b> is recommend"
  },
  {
    question: "What happen after the entire genome is treated with sodium bisulfite?",
    content: "Sequence reads diverge from the reference genome at each converted CpG site. Therefore, to map WGBS data to the reference genome, the reference needs also be bisulfite converted."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the advantages and limitations of WGBS?",
    content: "The advantage of using WGBS resides in the fact that it results in higher CpG densities, more than 10 CpG/100bp. In general, this method identifies 2 CpG/100bp, which corresponds to roughly 50% of the genome. It also gives the capability to evaluate the methylation status of nearly every CpG site. On the other hand, this method needs sufficient read depths to reliably determine methylation status and it is cost intensive when dealing with large genomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)",
    content: "To enrich for sections of the genome with a high CpG content, RRBS uses restriction enzymes and bisulfite sequencing. Focus coverage is made on the sections of the genome that have CpG dinucleotides, instead of the entire genome. It allows greater read depth compared to WGBS."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the advantages and limitations of RRBS?",
    content: "With RRBS method the data volume is reduced as well as the cost to perform the procedure. Also, DMRs are typically found in higher CpG density regions of 3 CpG/100 bp, which accounts for about 20% of the genome. However, since only a small portion of the genome is examined, the RRBS method has limitations when it comes to functional conclusions in species that do not have a good reference genome."
  },
  {
    question: "Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIPs)",
    content: "MeDIP-Seq method uses immunoprecipitation to enrich for the portion of the genome containing either (5mC) or (5hmC), which is then followed by high-throughput sequencing. The first whole-genome methylation profile of a mammalian genome was created using MeDIP-Seq. It uses anti-5-methylcytosine antibodies and magnetic beads to look for methylated genomic regions."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the are the advantages and limitations of MeDIPs?",
    content: "MeDIPs provides the highest percentage of coverage out of all other bisulfite sequencing methods. It covers CpG and non-CpG 5mC throughout the genome. It can be done on the Genome-wide scale or in any regions of interest and it requires low input data. However, this method is low density bias, the antibody used can only recognize methylation in regions with a certain threshold of CpG density. It is also not possible to do base pair resolution analysis with method."
  },
  {
    question: "Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing (TBS)",
    content: "This method uses a hybridization-based step on platforms with pre-designed oligos that capture CpG islands, gene promoters, and other significantly methylated regions. Alternatively, a PCR-based step could be used to amplify multiple bisulfite-converted DNA regions in a single reaction."
  },
  {
    question: "What alignment program one can use to map the reads to a reference genome?",
    content: "<ul> <li><b>BSMAP</b>: the first mapper for bisulfite data alignment. It indexes the genome using an efficient HASH table seeding algorithm, bitwise masking each nucleotide in the reads and the reference, and efficiently matching them to each other.</li>
<li><b>GSNAP</b> is a general-purpose mapper that can also handle bisulfite data. It uses a wild-card approach to match read seeds to genome regions and is based on special hash tables.</li>
<li><b>BS-Seeker2</b> an extension of BS Seeker that uses a three-letter approach to map bisulfite data. In addition to gapped alignment, it can filter out reads with incomplete bisulfite conversion, increasing specificity.</li>
<li><b>BWA-meth</b> is built on the BWA-mem aligner.</li>
<li><b>Segemehl</b> was originally intended to be a general-purpose mapper, but it has since been extended to handle bisulfite data. For the seed search, it employs a wild-card approach based on suffix arrays, as well as the Myers bit-vector algorithm for computing semi-global alignments.</li>
<li><b>Bismark</b> is a set of tools for the time-efficient analysis of Bisulfite-Seq (BS-Seq) data. Bismark performs alignments of bisulfite-treated reads to a reference genome and cytosine methylation calls at the same time. It is written in Perl and is run from the command line. Bisulfite-treated reads are mapped using the short-read aligner Bowtie 2, or alternatively HISAT2.</li>"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose aligner for methyl-seq data?",
    content: "Choosing your aligner depends on the type of data. If using RRBS and WGBS data, bismark is a good one to use. When you need to align Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation(MeDIP or mDIP) MeQA, or MEDIPS pipelines are useful."

  {
    question: "How do you ensure best output and visualization of methylation data?",
    content: "Pre-processing of sequencing reads is a must for best possible output and the visualization of the methylation data."

  {
    question: "What is good sequencing coverage for Methyl-Seq Sequencing?",
    content: "Large target regions: Probes should cover several hundred kilobases to several megabases of contiguous  sequence  including  exons,  introns, 5’ regulatory  regions, 3’ regulatory  regions,  and flanking regions.
                      Great specificity having longer probes (200-300bp)
                      Coverageof the targeted region including repeats"
  },
  {
    question: "Non-directional or paired-end RRBS libraries?",
    content: "Non-directional bisulfite sequencing is less common, but has been performed in a number of studies(Cokus et al. (2008), Popp et al. (2010), Smallwood et al. (2011), Hansen et al. (2011), Kobayashi al.(2012)). In this type of library, sequence reads may originate from all four possible bisulfite DNAstrands (original top (OT), complementary to OT (CTOT), original bottom (OB) or complementary toOB (CTOB)) with roughly the same likelihood.Paired-end reads do by definition contain one read from one of the original strands as well as onecomplementary strand. Please note that the CTOT or CTOB strands in a read pair are reversecomplements of the OT or OB strands, respectively, and thus they carry methylation information for
                    the exact same strand as their partner read but not for the other original DNA strand. Similar todirectional single-end libraries, the first read of directional paired-end libraries always comes fromeither the OT or OB strand. The first read of non-directional paired-end libraries may originate fromany of the four possible bisulfite strands.(see http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk)"

  {
    question: "How do I identify CpG islands?",
    content: "CpG islands are defined as sequence ranges where the Obs/Exp value is greater than 0.6 and the GC content is greater than 50%. The expected number of CpG dimers in a window is calculated as the number of  'C's  in  the  window  multiplied  by  the  number  of  'G's  in  the  window,  divided  by  the  window length

    question: "How do we account for bias in Methylation data?",
    content: "There are several hurdles to cross when analysing Methyl-seq data, particularly during the identification of DMRs. Normalization of read counts contribute to eliminate biases as a result of variability in sequencing depth between samples. While, global read count normalization can help address this problem, it does not account for ‘competition’ effects. For example, in RNA-seq  specific highly expressed genes can lead to a depressed read count in other genes introducing a bias when comparing samples. Same situation can be
                    found with MeDIP-seq, where sample-specific repeat methylation could potentially diminish reads in other genomic regions and introduce bias tothe analysis. Methods for calculating methylation have proven to be useful when identifying large global changes, for example hypomethylation, or hypermethylation regions of a given sample. However, these methods have not provided a framework for determining the location of DMRs in a statistically rigorous manner just yet. By using methods such as
                    DESeq that estimate variance in a local fashion, it is possible to remove potential selection biases. Additionally, DESeq estimates a flexible, mean-dependent local regression rather than attempting to reliably estimate both the variance and mean parameters of the distribution from limited numbers of replicates. Finally, False positive could be included in the  interpretation  of  your  data  by  differences  in  DNA  fragment  size  distributions  between  samples. Performing
                    fragment length normalization through read sub-sampling to equalize the distributions can eliminate this potential bias. Additional tools such as EdgeR, or methylkit can also be used.

									<li>Experiments  whose  purpose  is  to  evaluate  the  similarity  between  the  transcriptional  profiles  of two polyA+ samples may require only modest depths of sequencing (e.g. 30M pair-end reads of length > 30NT, of which 20-25M are 3 mappable to the genome or known transcriptome.</li>
									<li>Experiments   whose   purpose   is   the   discovery   of   noveltranscribed   elements   and   strong quantification   of   known   transcriptisoforms   requires   more   extensive   sequencing.   The   ability   to detectreliably low copy number transcripts / isoforms depends upon the depthof sequencing and on a sufficiently complex library.</li>

									<p>The HiSeq maximum yield isabout 200 mil reads. Roughly, one could figure 160 to 180 mil reads to be a safe count. This is enough for a 4 to 6 plex samples at 30M reads per RNA sample. The NextSeq has a max of about 400M reads. Figure  360M to  be safe. This is enough for a  10  to  12 plex at 30M reads per  RNA  sample.  Yes,  the  NextSeq  do  twice  the  plex  level  as  the  HiSeq.  Plus  it  does  a  75bp  read  as opposed to a 50bp read. So it is cheaper per base.</p>

									<p class="title">Do we need to include spike-in controls for RNA-seq normalization?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>here  is  no  standard  whether  to  use  spike-in  control  or  not,  I  guess  it  varies  case  to  case.  During sequencing  there  are  so  many  unknown  factors  one  can’t  control,  so  including  a  spike-in  would  be better as this would allow to evaluate performance of library preparation and sequencing, and thus less
									unbiased  call  for  differential  gene  expression  in  later  stages.  However,  there  have  been studies  that says  the  spike-in  controlled  data  may  be  very  biased  to  various  degree  unless  the  experiments  are designed in a careful way to preserve and capture true biological variations represented in your sample. As  the  spike-in  datasets  represent  only technical  replicates  with  minimal  variation,  this  could  be complemented  with  more  practical  comparisons  in  real  datasets  with  true  biological  replicates.  For example,  this  study  (<a>http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4404308</a>)  reports  that  spike-ins  are  not  reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. One of the advantages  of  using  spike  controls  for  normalization  is  the  possibility  of  relaxing  the  common assumption that majority of the genes are not DE between the conditions under study. So if you want to use  the  spike-ins  for  normalization,  two  conditions  must  be  satisfied:  (i)  spike-in  read  counts  are  not affected  by  the  biological  factors  of  interest,    and  (ii)  the  unwanted  variation  should  affect  the  spike-in and gene read counts similarly.</p>
									<p>One should  not confuse  with the definition  of spike-ins,  the  one between PhiX (used for  quality-control during  sequencing)  and  the  spike-ins  for  normalization purposes.  To  some  extent,  both  are  useful  for quality control and for library-size normalization. There is an External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) that  had  developed  a  set  of  92  synthetic  spike-in  standards  that  are  commercially  available  and relatively easy  to  add  to  a  typical  library  preparation.  So  you  can  select  various  formulation  mixes  of controls  from  these  kits  (or  could  be  custom  made)  and  use  in  your  experiments.  Ambion  (Life Technologies) is the only company that manufactures such spike-in controls for normalization purpose. You can find step-by-step details here on how and when to use Spike-ins <a>https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_086340.pdf</a>. The main idea here is to achieve a standard measure for data comparison across gene expression experiments, measure sensitivity (lower the limit of detection) and dynamic range of an experiment, and quantitate differential gene expression.</p>

									<p class="title">How important is the use of Spike-ins?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>In  the  view  of  DE  analysis,  all  the  normalization  methods  what  we  employ  during  the bioinformatics analysis downstream for between-sample normalizations thus far work properly, because we assume that majority of the genes are NOT differentially expressed between conditions under study, a  reasonable  assumption  in  most  applications.  Note  that  in  practice,  most  of  the  normalization procedures (bioinfo based, not spike-in based) work well even when a high proportion of genes are DE, provided that they are roughly equally distributed between up-and down-regulation. However, in cases where  there  is  a  major  global  shift  in  expression,  the  usual  between-sample  normalization  procedures will  fail.  In  this  case,  normalization  based  on  control  sequences  (spike-ins)  may  be  the  only  option. There  is  a  very  nice  book  chapter  here  (<a>http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-07212-8_9#page-1</a>) where it explains in detail about the role of spike-ins for normalization of RNA-seq.</p>

									<p class="title">Is it standard to use spike-ins in every RNA-seq experiment?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>It  depends  on  a  case  to  case  basis.  Although  there  are  very  few  reports  in  literature  where people have actually used spike-ins in real experiments. This is surprising. Maybe because of time and money, this is not always possible. Because most of the major RNA-seq guidelines and forums strongly recommend using spike-ins during the experiment designing and sequencing. The approach is strongly recommended by the ENCODE consortium (<a>http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/protocols/dataStandards/ENCODE_RNAseq_Standards_V1.0.pdf</a>). Then  there  is  one  recent  paper  just  published  in  2016  (A  survey  of  best  practices  for  RNA-seq)(<a>https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8</a>) which also recommends including the spike-ins for both the quality control as well as for library-size normalization. Another good read is (Synthetic spike-in standards for RNA-seq experiments) (<a>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816910</a>),   and   Revisiting   global   gene   expression   analysis (<a>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412012263</a>).</p>
									<p>n any case, it is essential to ensure that spike-in standards behave as expected and to develop a set of controls that are stable enough across the replicate libraries and robust to both the differences in library composition as well as library preparation methods.</p>

										<li>Depends on the purpose of the experiment</li>
										<li>Build a reference transcriptome if not available (Trinity, Trans-ABySS, Velvet / Oases)</li>
										<li><p>What if I don’t have a good reference genome?</p>
										<p>To  determine  whetherthe  reference  genome  is  well  annotated  or  not;  one  approach  could  be, for  example,  take  a  random  sample  of  raw  reads  (100  or  so)  from  both  the  first  and  second strand  of  your  paired-end  data  and  BLAST  them.  If  the  genome  assembly  is  poor,  you  would see that one pair of the read map to a different scaffold of the other read. Usually in the paired-end RNA-seq data, the reads must be less than 1000 bases apart on the same chromosome, or much  closer.  If  this  technique  does  not  work,  then  you  have  to  do de  novoassembly  of  your reads  and  then  align  your  reads  against  this  transcriptome.  I  think  you  can  combine  both approaches.  It  is  common  to  perform de  novoassembly  when  reference  genome  is  not available  or  is  poorly  annotated.  Basically  you  are  assembling  yourreads  into  longer  contigs and  then  to  treat  those  contigs  as  the  expressed  transcriptome  to  which  the  raw  reads  are mapped back again for quantification. There are several tools available for this.</p></li>

									<p>FPKM  is  very  similar  to  RPKM.  RPKM  was  made  for  single-end  RNA-seq,  where  every  read corresponded to a single fragment that was sequenced. FPKM was made for paired-end RNA-seq. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads can correspond to a single fragment, or, if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment. The only difference between RPKM and FPKM is that  FPKM  takes  into  account  that  two  reads  can  map  to  one  fragment  (and  soit doesn’t count this fragment twice).</p>

								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
										<li><p>Column-1  (logFC): <i>"For  a  particular  gene,  a  log2  fold  change  of  −1  for  condition  treated  vs untreated  means that the treatment induces a change in observed expression level of 2^−1 = 0.5 compared to the untreated condition.</i></p>
										<p><i>logFC -Fold change, generally refers to the ratio of average expression between two groups. edgeR uses exactTest() performs pair-wise tests for differential expression between two groups. log2FC=Log2(B)-Log2(A)</i></p>
										<p><i>When you're comparing two things: A and B, the fold change is A/B. A and B could be data sets reflecting gene expression measured under different conditions. If gene1 is 2-fold higher in A, the A/B ratio for gene1 is 2. If gene2 is 2-fold higher in B than A, the gene2 ratio is 0.5. However, edgeR displays the log2 of the ratio. Therefore genes up or down by a given amount (i.e. two-fold) have the same distance from equality, but the sign (+/-) changes. Thus gene1 would have logFC: 1, and gene2 would have logFC: -1, reflecting 2-fold up or down respectively. In log2 space the numbers are close enough. For instance: -2 is 4-fold down, -1 is 2-fold down, 0 is equal in A and B (a ratio of 1), 1 is 2-fold up, 2 is 4-fold up, etc. To convert the logFC value from edgeR (which are essentially ratios of the normalized count values per gene) into an up or down ratio, you simply take 2 to the power of the logFC number. e.g. for a gene with logFC of 0.5 or -0.5: the ratio is 2^0.5 = 1.4, or 2^-0.5 = 0.7, respectively.</i></p>
										<p><i>Let's say there are 50 read counts in control and 100 read counts in treatment for gene A. This means  gene A is  expressing twice in treatment as compared to control (100 divided by 50 =2) or  fold  change  is  2.  This  works  well  for  over  expressed  genes  as  the  number  directly corresponds  to  how  many  times  a  gene  is  overexpressed. But when  it  is  other  way  round  (i.e, treatment  50,  control  100),  the  value  of  fold  change  will  be  0.5  (all  underexpressed  genes  will have values between 0 to 1, while overexpressed genes will have values from 1 to infinity). To make this leveled, we use log2 for expressing the fold change. I.e, log2 of 2 is 1 and log2 of 0.5 is -1.</i></p>
										<p><b>The log Fold change value is calculated by taking the log2 of avg CPM value of mutant vs control. log2(avg.cpm.mut)/(avg.cpm.wt)</b></p>
										<p><a>http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=26610</a></p></li>
										<li><P>Column-2 (logCPM):</P>
										<p>log CPM refers to log (Counts per million reads). </p>
										<p>To calculate CPM manually in R it would be :</p>
										<p>cpm <-apply(countmatrix,2, function(x) (x/sum(x))*1000000) </p>
										<p># the 1 added to log function is to avoid log 0 values</p>
										<p>log.cpm <-log(cpm + 1)</p></li>
										<li><p>Column-3 (LR): Log Ratio / Likelihood Ratio: log2(X1 RPKM/ X2 RPKM).</p>
										<p>But, edgeR does not use RPKM, instead it calculates CPM (Counts per million). edgeR does not consider the  length  of  the  gene  for  normalization.  Read  counts  can  generally  be  expected  to  be  proportional  to length  as  well  as  to  expression  for  any  transcript,  but  edgeR  does  not  generally  need  to  adjust  for  gene length because gene length has the same relative influence on the read counts for each RNA sample. For this  reason,  normalization  issues  arise  only  to  the  extent  that  technical  factors  have  sample-specific effects.</p></li>
										<li>Column-4 (PValue): </li>
										<li>Column-5  (FDR): FDR  values  were  calculated  using  the  method  of  Benjamini  and  Hochberg  from  the distribution  of  2-way  ANOVA  p-values,  and  fold-change  values  were  calculated  on  a  linear  scale  using least squares mean.</li>

									<p>edgeR  uses  a  filtering  criteriato  remove  the  genes  with  low  filter  counts. Please  refer  to  page 11 of the edgeR user guide.</p>
									<p><a>https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf</a></p>
									<p><i>“A requirement for expression in two or more libraries is used as the minimum number of samples in each  group  is  two”. This ensures that a gene will be retained if it is only expressed in at least two groups.  Internally,  edgeR  is  using  the  following  code  to  filter  out  the  genes  based  on  the  CPM (Counts per million) values.</i></p>
									<p>> keep <-rowSums(cpm(y)>1) >= 2</p>
									<p>> y <-y[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]</p>
									<p>So by default, the cases that do not contain CPM of 1 or greater for at least 2 replicates, will be filtered out and thus gives ‘NA’ in the results file. Generally, it is preferred to use 3 replicates for RNA-Seq analysis, so a threshold of 2 works fine. In any case, if one would like to use a threshold of 1, the code could be modified.</p>

However,  since  all  genes  in  the  genome  (with  GO annotations)  are  indirectly  associated  with  the  top  level  term  "biological_process",  this  would  not  be significant if all the genes in a group were associated with this very high level term.</p>

								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Is a technique that can determine DNA methylation patterns. The major difference from regular sequencing experiments is that, in bisulfite sequencing DNA is treated with bisulfite which convert cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. By sequencing and aligning those converted DNA fragments it is possible to call methylation status on the methylation states of individual cytosines.</p>

								<div class="content">
									<p>Non-directional bisulfite sequencing is less common, but has been performed in a number of studies(Cokus et al. (2008), Popp et al. (2010), Smallwood et al. (2011), Hansen et al. (2011), Kobayashi al.(2012)). In this type of library, sequence reads may originate from all four possible bisulfite DNAstrands (original top (OT), complementary to OT (CTOT), original bottom (OB) or complementary toOB (CTOB)) with roughly the same likelihood.Paired-end reads do by definition contain one read from one of the original strands as well as onecomplementary strand. Please note that the CTOT or CTOB strands in a read pair are reversecomplements of the OT or OB strands, respectively, and thus they carry methylation information for
									the exact same strand as their partner read but not for the other original DNA strand. Similar todirectional single-end libraries, the first read of directional paired-end libraries always comes fromeither the OT or OB strand. The first read of non-directional paired-end libraries may originate fromany of the four possible bisulfite strands.(see <a>http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk</a>)</p>

									<p class="title">How do we account for bias in Methylation data?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>There are several hurdles to cross when analysing Methyl-seq data, particularly during the identification of DMRs. Normalization of read counts contribute to eliminate biases as a result of variability in sequencing depth between samples. While, global read count normalization can help address this problem, it does not account for ‘competition’ effects. For example, in RNA-seq  specific highly expressed genes can lead to a depressed read count in other genes introducing a bias when comparing samples. Same situation can be
									found with MeDIP-seq, where sample-specific repeat methylation could potentially diminish reads in other genomic regions and introduce bias tothe analysis. Methods for calculating methylation have proven to be useful when identifying large global changes, for example hypomethylation, or hypermethylation regions of a given sample. However, these methods have not provided a framework for determining the location of DMRs in a statistically rigorous manner just yet. By using methods such as
									<b>DESeq</b> that estimate variance in a local fashion, it is possible to remove potential selection biases. Additionally, DESeq estimates a flexible, mean-dependent local regression rather than attempting to reliably estimate both the variance and mean parameters of the distribution from limited numbers of replicates. Finally, False positive could be included in the  interpretation  of  your  data  by  differences  in  DNA  fragment  size  distributions  between  samples. Performing
									<b>fragment length normalization</b> through read sub-sampling to equalize the distributions can eliminate this potential bias. Additional tools such as <b>EdgeR</b>, or <b>methylkit</b> can also be used.</p>
